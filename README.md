# Data Science Best Practices

## What is this site?
This site contains documents describing best practices for software development
and data science projects within the City of Los Angeles. It is not intended to be
prescriptive, so much as a collection of hard-earned lessons regarding best practices
and the reasoning behind those practices.

This is a living document -- pull requests are welcome!
