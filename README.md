# Data Science Best Practices

## What is this site?
This site contains documents describing best-practices for software development
and data science projects within the City of Los Angeles. It not intended to be
prescriptive, so much as a collection of hard-earned lessons regarding best-practices
and the reasoning behind those practices.

This is a living document -- pull requests are welcome!
