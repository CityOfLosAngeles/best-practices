# Academic Partnerships
## Data Sharing
It’s vital to avoid having to go back to a department partner and ask for more data, make sure you get what you need for your academic partner up front. Aim to include a data dictionary and schema. 

Ensure your department partner is comfortable with the way data will be shared, these include FTP, dropbox, email, open data portal, usb drive, and others. 

If have do additional data sharing or data enhancements with third parties, ensure your department partner is aware of how the data work will occur. Possible third party partners are for-profit companies, advocacy groups, professional organizations, nonprofits and other academic institutions. 

To be efficient with time, strive to provide data that is clean and structured in a way that makes it easy for the student team to dive in. 

Include schema, dictionaries, definitions, diagrams and any other materials that might help student groups better understand the data. 

## Non-Disclosures

## Structure
Project schedules vary depending on the length of the collaboration. Time frames are usually anchored around the school’s semester schedule, yet projects can be as short as 1 week of scoping and 3 weeks of work, or longer than one semester broken out into multiple sprints. 

Regardless of time length, you can envision a project in 3 phases:

Scoping
Work
Results

Scoping is likely done during Fall semester (August - December) and works happens during Spring (January - May). 

The scoping phase calls for a series of meetings, ideally no more than 3, where all partners involved identify and agree on a specific problem statement, expected deliverable and the remainder of the project schedule. 

The work phase kicks off once the student group has officially began analysis. 

## Scoping
Scoping agreement should be reflected in a simple and short scoping document highlighting partners involved, point people across departments and partners, project manager/main point of contact, expected deliverable and format, timeline and checkpoints. 

Aim for a very specific problem statement that generates an actionable, relevant answer that impacts existing efforts. 

Deliverable should be in a format or media that can be easily brought into existing effort. 

Ensure department partner’s leadership and relevant team members have input in and approve the scope.
